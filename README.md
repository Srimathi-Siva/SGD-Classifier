# SGD-Classifier
## AIM:
To write a program to predict the type of species of the Iris flower using the SGD Classifier.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
 1. Import Necessary Libraries and Load Data
  
 2.Split Dataset into Training and Testing

 3.Train the Model Using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
 
 4.Make Predictions
 and Evaluate Accuracy
 
 5.Generate Confusion Matrix
## Program:
```
